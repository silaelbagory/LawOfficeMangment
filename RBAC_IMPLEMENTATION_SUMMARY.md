## 🔧 **System Features**

### **Role System**
- **Manager**: Full access to everything + user management capabilities
- **Lawyer**: Limited access based on assigned permissions

### **Permission System**
- `casesRead` / `casesWrite` - Case management permissions
- `clientsRead` / `clientsWrite` - Client management permissions
- `documentsRead` / `documentsWrite` - Document management permissions
- `reportsRead` / `reportsWrite` - Report access permissions
- `usersRead` / `usersWrite` - User management permissions

### **Action Logging**
- Automatic logging of all lawyer actions
- Real-time viewing with filtering capabilities
- Detailed metadata for each action
- Statistics and analytics support

### **Security**
- Firestore security rules enforce permissions
- Only managers can create/manage lawyers
- Lawyers can only perform allowed actions
- All actions are logged and auditable

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### **1. Deploy Firestore Rules**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### **2. Create Manager Account**
You'll need to manually create the first manager account in Firebase Console:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Authentication
2. Add a new user with email/password
3. Go to Firestore and create a document in `users` collection with:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "user-uid",
     "name": "Manager Name",
     "email": "manager@example.com",
     "role": "manager",
     "permissions": {
       "casesRead": true,
       "casesWrite": true,
       "clientsRead": true,
       "clientsWrite": true,
       "documentsRead": true,
       "documentsWrite": true,
       "reportsRead": true,
       "reportsWrite": true,
       "usersRead": true,
       "usersWrite": true
     },
     "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
     "isActive": true
   }
   ```

### **3. Test the System**
1. Login with the manager account
2. Create test lawyer accounts with different permissions
3. Test permission-based access
4. Verify action logging works

### **4. Integrate Existing Screens**
Use the examples in `RBAC_USAGE_EXAMPLES.md` to:
- Add permission checks to existing UI elements
- Integrate action logging into existing operations
- Update navigation based on user roles

## 📋 **Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Deploy Firestore security rules
- [ ] Create manager account
- [ ] Test manager login
- [ ] Create lawyer account through UI
- [ ] Test lawyer login
- [ ] Verify permission-based UI changes
- [ ] Test action logging
- [ ] Verify Firestore security rules work
- [ ] Test with different permission combinations

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**
1. **Permission denied errors**: Check Firestore security rules are deployed
2. **Missing UI elements**: Verify permission checks in widgets
3. **Action logging not working**: Ensure ActionCubit is properly initialized
4. **User not found errors**: Verify user document exists in Firestore

### **Debug Tips**
1. Check user role and permissions in Firestore
2. Verify Firestore security rules are deployed
3. Use Firebase Console to monitor action logs
4. Check console for permission-related errors
